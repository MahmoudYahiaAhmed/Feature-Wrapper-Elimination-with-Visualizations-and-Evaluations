# Feature-Wrapper-Elimination-with-Visualizations-and-Evaluations
## Diabetes-Prediction

Our goal in this study is to determine a patient's likelihood of having diabetes based on a variety of factors, including glucose level, insulin, age, and BMI. 
We will complete every stage, including data collection and model implementation. We compare multiple machine learning algorithms using the accuracy score 
measure during the model evaluation process to see which is better. Then we use Flask, a Python micro framework, to build a web application.
